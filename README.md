============

Started as a Open source 'clone' of Spaceship Artemis - A bridge simulator. But has already deviated from the old spaceship artemis. It supports a game-master mode and multiple AI factions. We strive to get this working on all major platforms (Windows, Linux and Mac) but only windows support is guarenteed. 

The game is built on top of the SeriousProton engine and uses SFML for most of the heavy lifting. 

If there is anyone willing to contribute, we're mostly looking for awesome models, sound effects and music. The game will be tested regulary by some of our trusty colleagues.
